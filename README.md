## Introduction

Welcome to the Petals Pipeline project! This repository houses the code for an innovative data processing and analysis pipeline designed to efficiently handle and process large volumes of data.
Leveraging cutting-edge technologies and algorithms, the Petals Pipeline aims to provide a robust and scalable solution for data scientists and developers alike.

## Features

- Data Tokenization and Analysis: Automated processing of incoming data, including tokenization, language detection, and token count.
- Secure Data Storage: Utilizing immudb for secure, key-value storage of processed data.
- Enhanced Security in V2: Future updates will include TOTP-based encryption and decryption for enhanced data security.
- Compatibility and Library Support: Including support for the Petals library and a workaround for UVLoop on Windows platforms named `WindowsLoop`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker (for container management)
- Python 3.8 or later
- Access to a terminal or command line interface
```

###Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
